   Hi Che, when I first    met you, I had no idea <br>
   <br>
   I was going to get this attached to  you because I really didn’t care <br>
   <br>
   that much about you at the time. I like you—oo, gusto kita matagal na. <br>
   <br>
   Di ko lang masabi sa’yo kasi I’m afraid to lose you. I never thought I’d <br>
   <br>
   like you, but here I am, admiring you from afar. Every time I see you, <br>
   <br>
   I will always smile. No words can ever express my feelings for you. <br>
   <br>
   I love how caring, funny, and loving you are. I fell in love with <br>
   <br>
   those personalities, not just your looks, and I can’t imagine how <br>
   <br>
   lucky the person you like is, knowing that would never be me. <br>
   <br>
   If you could give me a chance to love you,<br>
   <br>
   I’ll love you with all my heart. <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>

Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️🌹
